            <p>Cthulhu is a Great Old One of great power that lies in a death-<br>
               like slumber beneath the Pacific Ocean in his sunken city of R'lyeh.<br> 
               He remains a dominant presence in the eldrich dealings on our world.</p>
            <p>"They were not composed altogether of flesh and blood. They had shape [...]<br> 
                but that shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right,<br> 
                They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong,<br>
                They could not live. But although They no longer lived, They would never really die.<br> 
                They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the<br> 
                spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and<br> 
                the earth might once more be ready for Them.â€ž</p>

                Yog-Sothoth is the gate.<br>

                Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth.<br>

                and why no one can behold Them as They tread."</p>
            <p>Yog-Sothoth is a cosmic entity and Outer God. <br>
                Born of the Nameless Mist, he is the progenitor of Cthulhu,<br>
